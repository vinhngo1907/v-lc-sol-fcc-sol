# Technical Test - Readme

## 1. Local Development Guideline

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v16 or newer), npm and yarn

### Setup Local Development Environment
1. Clone the project to local machine and go to the folder:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vinhngo1907/henry-technical-test.git
    cd henry-technical-test
```
2. Run make setup to install dependencies and setup the local DB (Run migration and seeding).

3. Run yarn dev to run the client and back-end in development mode (live-reload support).

4. The app should be accessible at ```http://localhost:3000```. The API can be accessed at ```http://localhost:3001```.

**Notes**: The local DB will use port 25432. If the port is being used, please change it to a different port in docker-compose.yml and server/.env.

### Useful Commands
1. If you want to reset or server separately, go to client, server folders and run yarn dev in each.
2. Run yarn lint to find and fix issues.
3. Run yarn db:update to update the schema, it will also run yarn typeorm migration:generate -n MigrationName. The models will be generated automatically (See TypeORM migration)
4. Back-end: ```bash yarn db:migrate``` to run the migration.

## 2. Deployment Guildline

### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud SDK
- Permission to access resources in henry-technical-2 project
- Credentials of __*****__ Statging DB

### Deployment Steps

Front-end: Run ```yarn deploy``` to deploy to GCP. If we migrate to Google Storage, then use deploy.sh instead.
Back-end: 
1. Update the values in server/.env.production. If you don't have it, consider following the template in server/.env.
2. Update the value in that file
```bash
DB_HOST={PRODUCTION_DB_HOST}
DB_PORT={PRODUCTION_DB_PORT}
DB_USER={PRODUCTION_DB_USER}
DB_PASSWORD={PRODUCTION_DB_PASSWORD}
DB_DATABASE_NAME={PRODUCTION_DB_DATABASE_NAME}
GOOGLE_STORE_BUCKET={PRODUCTION_GOOGLE_STORE_BUCKET}
JWT_SECRET={PRODUCTION_JWT_SECRET}
```
3. The file should NEVER been committed to source control, because it contains sensitive information.
4. Run yarn deploy to deploy to Google App Engine.

### CI/CD Setup
The project use TravisCI for CI/CD. The project can be accessed at Henry Technical Test. Please modify /server/.travis.yml. If you want to update the build and CI process.

## 3. Other Notes
### What I have completed
**1. Functionalities**
1. Showing menu: Categories and Food. Show Food Detail when clicked.
2. Fake login/logout, using JWT for authentication.
3. Individual Cart: Add/Edit/Delete.
4. Group Cart: Join Cart as Temporary User, Leave Cart, Delete the whole cart.
5. For simplicity, the cart will be synced every 10 seconds of using real-time technology.
**2. Deployment Process**
1. Front-end:
2. Back-end: 
3. Database:
4. CI server:

# What can be improved
1. More unit tests for back-end.
2. Write some end-to-end tests.
3. Real-time sync for Group Cart using socket.io.
4. The front-end can be built & deployed to Google Storage for faster performance.
5. We can create 1 more branch called releases. The CI should support deploying the app when code is merged to this branch.
